DEPENDENCIES
    *   This module works only on linux.

    *   perl 5.8.0

DESCRIPTION
    "Sys::Proctitle" provides an interface for setting the process title
    shown by "ps", "top" or similar tools on Linux. Why do we need this? One
    could simply change $0 to achieve the same result. Well, first setting
    $0 did not work with 5.8.0. Further, setting $0 won't work with
    mod_perl.

  Procedural Interface
    *setproctitle( arg1, arg2, ... argN )*
        all arguments are joined with "\0". The resulting string is set as
        process title.

    *getproctitle()*
        returns the current process title. On Linux the space useable as
        process title consists of the original space for argv the process
        was executed with plus the space of the original environment. This
        function returns the current content of this buffer.

        The length of the returned string is the maximum process title
        length.

  Object Interface
    *new( arg1, arg2, ... argN )*
        the current process title is saved. Then the arguments are passed to
        "setproctitle".

    *DESTROY()*
        restores the saved process title.

EXPORT
    None by default.

    On demand "setproctitle" and "getproctitle" are exported.

    The ":all" Exporter tag exports "setproctitle" and "getproctitle".
